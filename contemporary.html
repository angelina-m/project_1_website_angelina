  <h1> Contemporary </h1>
  <p> Contemporary dance developed during the mid twentieth century and now has become one of the most popular genres among formally trained dancers.
      Contemporary dancers are encouraged to improvise, unlike the strict style of ballet.
      They focus mostly on footwork dance with barefeet.
      Contemporary dance doesn't have to be done to slow music, it can be performed to many different styles of music.
      Here is an example of a Contempoary performance choreographed by Travis Wall:
