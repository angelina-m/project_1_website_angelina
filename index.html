   <h3> Hip Hop </h3>
   <p> Street dance is defined as a dance style that is created outside of dance studios in any available open space.
    One thing that makes street dances different from stage dance is that it's interactive and improvised most of the time.
    It can range from traditional jazz, hip hop, urban folk dance, punk and house dance.
    Although I would love to discuss the other genres of street dance, I'm mainly going to focus on different styles of hip hop street dance.
    Some styles I'll talk about are b-boying, freestyle, and animation. </p>

   <h3> Contemporary </h3>
   <p> Stage dance is usually "a theatrical representation of a story that is performed to music by trained dancers."
      Genres that would be considered as a stage dance would be ballet, tap, ballroom, and contemporary.
    Contemporary is an expressive dance that combines elements from several different genres such as modern, jazz, lyrical, and classical ballet. </p>
