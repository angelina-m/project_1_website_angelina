  <h1> Hip Hop </h1>
   <p> Hip Hop refers to street dance styles that are performed to hip hop music or that has evolved as part of hip hop culture.
       The styles include b-boying, popping, and locking which were created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the USA.
       Hip hop dancers can also define themselves as a specific type of dancer (such as a popper, b-boy, or krumper), while a dancer that does a genre such as contemporary would just be known as a contemporary dancer.
       Another aspect that distinguishes hip hop from other forms of dance is that it is often "freestyle" or improvised.
       Most of the time, hip hop dancers have freestyle competiitions called "battles."

  <h2> Animation </h2>
   <p> Animation dance is a sub-category of popping that combines different skills such as strobing, robotics and gliding.
       This dance style gets its name from the way dancers imitate stop-motion animation films with jerky and flashy poses.
       It inspires a lot of creativity and variety- pretty much every animator has strikingly individual moves.
