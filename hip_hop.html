       The styles include b-boying, popping, and locking which were created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the USA.
       The thing that distinguishes hip hop from other forms of dance is that it is often "freestyle" or improvised.

   <p> Animation dance is a sub-category of popping that combines different skills such as strobing, robotics and gliding.
       This dance style gets its name from the way dancers imitate stop-motion animation films with jerky and flashy poses.
